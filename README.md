# TITLE
 Group 14 : Pierre-Antoine Desplaces, Guillaume Gavillet, Lennard Ludwig, Simon Maksay.
 
 
## Repository architecture
- `project.ipynb` contains all the code of the project.
- `results` contains the drawings of the different graphs we explored in the `fig` directory and all the numerical results in the `log.csv`file.

## Reproducability
In order to run the notebook and play with the code, you only need to create a data folder at the root and unzip this [folder](https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_metadata.zip) in it.
